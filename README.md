- `notebooks/`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of ARIMA for each forecasting task.
  - `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showcasing ARIMA for stock price prediction. Include data preprocessing, model training, and forecast visualization.
  - `energy_consumption_forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating ARIMA for energy consumption forecasting. Include data preprocessing, model training, and forecast visualization.
- `README.md`: You are here! It provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.
- `requirements.txt`: List the required Python packages and their versions to ensure reproducibility.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alimajnoon1377/Time-Series-Forecasting-ARIMA.git
   
   
Set up a Python environment and install the necessary dependencies:
cd Time-Series-Forecasting-ARIMA
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook (stock_price_prediction.ipynb and energy_consumption_forecasting.ipynb) to understand the ARIMA implementation for stock price prediction and energy consumption forecasting.

Run the code cells to execute the model training, forecasting, and visualization.

Experiment with different parameters, try different datasets, or modify the code to further explore ARIMA forecasting.

Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies.

Create and activate a new Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages using pip:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Examples
Stock Price Prediction
The notebooks/stock_price_prediction.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to use the ARIMA model for stock price prediction.

Ensure that you have the stock price dataset in the data/ folder. Modify the notebook to use your own dataset or provide the required file format and column names.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the ARIMA model, and visualize the forecasted stock prices.

Energy Consumption Forecasting
The notebooks/energy_consumption_forecasting.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to use the ARIMA model for energy consumption forecasting.

Ensure that you have the energy consumption dataset in the data/ folder. Modify the notebook to use your own dataset or provide the required file format and column names.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the ARIMA model, and visualize the forecasted energy consumption.
